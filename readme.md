# Spotinode

#### This package is UNDER DEVELOPMENT and might not work properly

NOTE: The ability to get an anonymous token from Spotify was brought to my attention by [skdhg (Arch)](https://github.com/skdhg). Be sure to check out their projects such as [Discord Player](https://github.com/Androz2091/discord-player) and [Mediaplex](https://github.com/androzdev/mediaplex)

## Installing the package

```bash
npm i spotinode
# or
yarn add spotinode
```
